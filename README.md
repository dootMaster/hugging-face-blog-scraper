# Hugging Face Blog Reader

A terminal-based reader for Hugging Face blog posts with a clean, readable interface and convenient navigation.

## Why?

Colorful headers, animated sidebars, social media buttons, and other UI elements compete for attention when you just want to focus on the content. This minimal terminal reader strips away the visual noise and presents articles in a clean, distraction-free format.
